# Create source tarballs for Puppet Server from released RPMs

## Usage
```
make puppetserver-5.3.6.tar.gz
```

## Updating sources
```
make puppetserver-5.3.6.spec
```

## How to Build - Special Cases

Since Puppetlabs went closed source with the RPM, the sources for puppetserver must be generated by our team. This document will outline the process taken for any given update.

## Updating trapperkeeper-webserver-jetty9

I had to create a clojars account and store it:

 - https://clojars.org/org.clojars.ehelms/trapperkeeper-webserver-jetty9

* clone https://github.com/ehelms/trapperkeeper-webserver-jetty9
* git checkout <branch>

This branch contains an update to the jetty version.

- build ezbake-builder container
- build lein install

podman run -it -v ./:/code:Z ezbake-builder /bin/bash

```
lein install
lein deploy clojars
```

Then need to update puppetserver to generate the jar.

Use this clone of the repo:

On this branch:

And then run these commands using the ezbake-builder container:
